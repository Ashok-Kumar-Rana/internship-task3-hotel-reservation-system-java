🏨 Hotel Reservation System 

This is a simple Hotel Reservation System built in Java for the CodeAlpha Internship – Task 3.
It allows users to book, cancel, and view hotel rooms using a console-based menu.

The main goal of this project is to practice Java programming, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and File Handling in a real-world example.

✨ Features

🛒 Book a Room – Enter your name and room number to make a booking.
❌ Cancel Booking – Cancel your room booking easily using your name.
💳 Payment Simulation – Confirms booking only after simulated payment.
📋 View All Bookings – See all active customer bookings.
💾 File Storage – Saves room and booking data in a file (hotel_data.txt) so it stays even after closing the program.
